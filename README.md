# Remove Yellow ChatGPT Filter
This is a simple yet powerful PSD file to remove from your generated images the annoying yellowish filter ChatGPT applies over them.

## Where?
Have tested it with several generated images, it works 95% of the time (especially with cartoons). But you can also make a few tweaks, just need to double click each effect layer (inside FX folder) and edit them as you'd like.

## How to use it
Simply download the file, open it and place your image below the FX folder. Resize the frame as necessary.
