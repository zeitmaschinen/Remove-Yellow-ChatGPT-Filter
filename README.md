# Remove Yellow ChatGPT Filter
This is a simple yet powerful PSD file to remove from your generated images the annoying yellowish filter ChatGPT applies over them.

## How to use it
Simply download the file, open it and place your image below the FX folder. You can get rid of the image I placed it there as well. It only serves as an example.

## Editing it
You can also double click each effect (selective color / levels) to edit them as you'd like.
